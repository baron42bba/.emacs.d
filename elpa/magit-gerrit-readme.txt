Magit plugin to make Gerrit code review easy-to-use from emacs and
without the need for a browser!

Currently uses the [deprecated] gerrit ssh interface, which has
meant that obtaining the list of reviewers is not possible, only
the list of approvals (those who have already verified and/or code
reviewed).
