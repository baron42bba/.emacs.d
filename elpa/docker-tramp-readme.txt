`docker-tramp.el' offers a TRAMP method for Docker containers.

> **NOTE**: `docker-tramp.el' relies in the `docker exec` command.  Tested
> with docker version 1.6.x but should work with versions >1.3

## Usage

Offers the TRAMP method `docker` to access running containers

    C-x C-f /docker:user@container:/path/to/file

    where
      user           is the user that you want to use (optional)
      container      is the id or name of the container

## Troubleshooting

### Tramp hangs on Alpine container

Busyboxes built with the `ENABLE_FEATURE_EDITING_ASK_TERMINAL' config option
send also escape sequences, which `tramp-wait-for-output' doesn't ignores
correctly.  Tramp upstream fixed in [98a5112][] and is available since
Tramp>=2.3.

For older versions of Tramp you can dump [docker-tramp-compat.el][] in your
`load-path' somewhere and add the following to your `init.el', which
overwrites `tramp-wait-for-output' with the patch applied:

    (require 'docker-tramp-compat)
