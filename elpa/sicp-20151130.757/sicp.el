;; The second edition of the book Structure and Interpretation of
;; Computer Programs (SICP) in info format.

;; This library provides the feature `sicp' and does nothing else.
;; This allows making the info file available on Melpa.  The texi
;; file was taken from http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi.  The
;; html version can be found at https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp.

;; If you want to recreate the info file, you can do so using
;;
;;   makeinfo â€“no-split sicp.texi -o sicp.info

;;; Code:

(provide 'sicp)
