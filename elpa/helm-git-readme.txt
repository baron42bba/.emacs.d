Helm Git extension makes opening files from current Git repository
fast and easy. It uses Git binary (using magit) to get list of
project files so it's prety fast even for large projects with
thousands of files. It also takes into account .gitignore file so
that you only get real project files. Magit should also make it
usable on wide variety of OS.
