Modern on-the-fly syntax checking for GNU Emacs.

Provide `flycheck-mode' which enables on-the-fly syntax checking for a large
number of different modes and languages (see `flycheck-checkers' for a
complete list).

Support for new modes and languages can be added by defining a new syntax
checker (see `flycheck-define-checker').
