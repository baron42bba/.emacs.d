This is news.info, produced by makeinfo version 6.5 from news.texi.

Bug Fixes in 18.10.2:
   * ESS[R] Fix namespace evaluation in non-installed packages.
     Evaluation is directed into GlobalEnv as originally intended.
   * 'Makefile' fixes, notably for 'make install' and including full
     docs in the tarballs.

   Bug Fixes in 18.10-1:
   * New functions 'ess-eval-line-visibly-and-step' ('C-c C-n' and
     'ess-eval-region-or-line-visibly-and-step' ('C-RET') which behave
     as the old versions of 'ess-eval-line-and-step' and
     'ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step'.

   Changes and New Features in 18.10:

   * This is the last release to support Emacs older than 25.1.  Going
     forward, only GNU Emacs 25.1 and newer will be supported.  Soon
     after this release, support for older Emacs versions will be
     dropped from the git master branch.  Note that MELPA uses the git
     master branch to produce ESS snapshots, so if you are using Emacs <
     25.1 from MELPA and are unable to upgrade, you should switch to
     MELPA-stable.

   * ESS now displays the language dialect in the mode-line.  So, for
     example, R buffers will now show ESS[R] rather than ESS[S].

   * The ESS manual has been updated and revised.

   * The ESS initialization process has been further streamlined.  If
     you update the autoloads (which installation from 'package-install'
     does), you should not need to '(require 'ess-site)' at all, as
     autoloads should automatically load ESS when it is needed (e.g.
     the first time an R buffer is opened).  In order to defer loading
     your ESS config, you may want to do something like
     '(with-require-after-load "ess" <ess-config-here>)' in your Emacs
     init file.  Users of the popular 'use-package' Emacs package can
     now do '(use-package ess :defer t)' to take advantage of this
     behavior.  *Note (ess)Activating and Loading ESS:: for more
     information on this feature.

   * ESS now respects Emacs conventions for keybindings.  This means
     that The 'C-c [letter]' bindings have been removed.  This affects
     'C-c h', which was bound to 'ess-eval-line-and-step-invisibly' in
     'sas-mode-local-map'; 'C-c f', which was bound to
     'ess-insert-function-outline' in 'ess-add-MM-keys'; and 'C-c h',
     which was bound to 'ess-handy-commands' in 'Rd-mode-map',
     'ess-noweb-minor-mode-map', and 'ess-help-mode-map'

   * Functions 'ess-eval-line-and-step' and
     'ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step' now behave consistently with
     other evaluation function inside a package.

   * ESS[R]: 'ess-r-package-use-dir' now works with any mode.  This sets
     the working directory to the root of the current package including
     for example C or C++ files within '/src').

   * ESS[R]: Long + + prompts in the inferior no longer offset output.

   * ESS[R]: New option 'strip' for 'inferior-ess-replace-long+'.  This
     strips the entire + + sequence.

   * ESS modes now inherit from 'prog-mode'.  In the next release, ESS
     modes will use 'define-derived-mode' so that each mode will have
     (for example) its own hooks and keymaps.

   * ESS[R]: Supports flymake in R buffers for Emacs 26 and newer.
     Users need to install the 'lintr' package to use it.  Customizable
     options include 'ess-use-flymake', 'ess-r-flymake-linters', and
     'ess-r-flymake-lintr-cache'.

   * ESS[R]: Gained support for xref in Emacs 25+.  *Note (emacs)Xref::

   * ESS[R]: The startup screen is cleaner.  It also displays the
     startup directory with an explicit 'setwd()'.

   * ESS[R]: Changing the working directory is now always reflected in
     the process buffer.

   * ESS[R]: 'Makevars' files open with 'makefile-mode'.

   * New variable 'ess-write-to-dribble'.  This allows users to disable
     the dribble ('*ESS*') buffer if they wish.

   * All of the '*-program-name' variables have been renamed to
     '*-program'.  Users who previously customized e.g.
     'inferior-ess-R-program-name' will need to update their
     customization to 'inferior-ess-R-program'.  These variables are
     treated as risky variables.

   * 'ess-smart-S-assign' was renamed to 'ess-insert-assign'.  It
     provides similar functionality but for any keybinding, not just
     '_'.  For instance if you bind it to ';', repeated invokations
     cycle through between assignment and inserting ';'.

   * 'C-c C-=' is now bound to 'ess-cycle-assign' by default.  See the
     documentation for details.  New user customization option
     'ess-assign-list' controls which assignment operators are cycled.

   * ESS[R] In remote sessions, the ESSR package is now fetched from
     GitHub.

   * Commands that send the region to the inferior process now deal with
     rectangular regions.  See the documentation of 'ess-eval-region'
     for details.  This only works on Emacs 25.1 and newer.

   * ESS[R]: Improvements to interacting with iESS in non-R files.
     Interaction with inferior process in non-R files within packages
     (for instance C or C++ files) has been improved.  This is a work in
     progress.

   * ESS[R]: Changing the working directory is now always reflected in
     the process buffer.

   * ESS[JAGS]: *.jog and *.jmd files no longer automatically open in
     JAGS mode.

   Many improvements to fontification:

   * Improved customization for faces.  ESS now provides custom faces
     for (nearly) all faces used and places face customization options
     into their own group.  Users can customize these options using 'M-x
     customize-group RET ess-faces'.

   * Many new keywords were added to 'ess-R-keywords' and
     'ess-R-modifiers'.  See the documentation for details.

   * ESS[R]: 'in' is now only fontified when inside a 'for' construct.
     This avoids spurious fontification, especially in the output buffer
     where 'in' is a commond English word.

   * ESS: Font-lock keywords are now generated lazily.  That means you
     can now add or remove keywords from variables like 'ess-R-keywords'
     in your Emacs configuration file after loading ESS (i.e.  in the
     ':config' section for 'use-package' users).

   * ESS[R]: Fontification of roxygen '@param' keywords now supports
     comma-separated parameters.

   * ESS[R]: Certain keywords are only fontified if followed by a
     parenthesis.  Function-like keywords such as 'if ()' or 'stop()'
     are no longer fontified as keyword if not followed by an opening
     parenthesis.  The same holds for search path modifiers like
     'library()' or 'require()'.

   * ESS[R]: Fixed fontification toggling.  Especially certain syntactic
     elements such as '%op%' operators and backquoted function
     definitions.

   * ESS[R]: 'ess-font-lock-toggle-keyword' can be called interactively.
     This command asks with completion for a font-lock group to toggle.
     This functionality is equivalent to the font-lock menu.

   Notable bug fixes:

   * 'prettify-symbols-mode' no longer breaks indentation.  This is
     accomplished by having the pretty symbols occupy the same number of
     characters as their non-pretty cousins.  You may customize the new
     variable 'ess-r-prettify-symbols' to control this behavior.

   * ESS: Inferior process buffers are now always displayed on startup.
     Additionally, they don't hang Emacs on failures.

   Obsolete libraries, functions, and variables:

   * The 'ess-r-args.el' library has been obsoleted and will be removed
     in the next release.  Use 'eldoc-mode' instead, which is on by
     default.

   * Functions and options dealing with the smart assign key are
     obsolete.  The following functions have been made obsolete and will
     be removed in the next release of ESS: 'ess-smart-S-assign',
     'ess-toggle-S-assign', 'ess-toggle-S-assign-key',
     'ess-disable-smart-S-assign'.

     The variable 'ess-smart-S-assign-key' is now deprecated and will be
     removed in the next release.  If you would like to continue using
     '_' for insterting assign in future releases, please bind
     'ess-insert-assign' in 'ess-mode-map' the normal way.

   * ESS[S]: Variable 'ess-s-versions-list' is obsolete and ignored.
     Use 'ess-s-versions' instead.  You may pass arguments by starting
     the inferior process with the universal argument.

   Changes and New Features in 17.11:

   * The ESS initialisation process has been streamlined.  You can now
     load the R and Stata modes independently from the rest of ESS. Just
     put '(require 'ess-r-mode)' or '(require 'ess-stata-mode)' in your
     init file.  This is for experienced Emacs users as this requires
     setting up autoloads for '.R' files manually.  We will keep
     maintaining 'ess-site' for easy loading of all ESS features.

   * Reloading and quitting the process is now more robust.  If no
     process is attached, ESS now switches automatically to one
     (prompting you for selection if there are several running).
     Reloading and quitting will now work during a debug session or when
     R is prompting for input (for instance after a crash).  Finally,
     the window configuration is saved and restored after reloading to
     prevent the buffer of the new process from capturing the cursor.

   * ESS[R]: New command 'ess-r-package-use-dir'.  It sets the working
     directory of the current process to the current package directory.

   * ESS[R] Lookup for references in inferior buffers has been improved.
     New variable 'ess-r-package-source-roots' contains package
     sub-directories which are searched recursively during the file
     lookup point.  Directories in 'ess-tracebug-search-path' are now
     also searched recursively.

   * ESS[R] Namespaced evaluation is now automatically enabled only in
     the 'R/' directory.  This way ESS will not attempt to update
     function definitions from a package if you are working from e.g.  a
     test file.

   Changes and New Features in 16.10:

   * ESS[R]: Syntax highlighting is now more consistent.  Backquoted
     names are not fontified as strings (since they really are
     identifiers).  Furthermore they are now correctly recognised when
     they are function definitions or function calls.
   * ESS[R]: Backquoted names and '%op%' operators are recognised as
     sexp.  This is useful for code navigation, e.g.  with 'C-M-f' and
     'C-M-b'.
   * ESS[R]: Integration of outline mode with roxygen examples fields.
     You can use outline mode's code folding commands to fold the
     examples field.  This is especially nice to use with well
     documented packages with long examples set.  Set
     'ess-roxy-fold-examples' to non-nil to automatically fold the
     examples field when you open a buffer.
   * ESS[R]: New experimental feature: syntax highlighting in roxygen
     examples fields.  This is turned off by default.  Set
     'ess-roxy-fontify-examples' to non-nil to try it out.
   * ESS[R]: New package development command 'ess-r-devtools-ask' bound
     to 'C-c C-w C-a'.  It asks with completion for any devtools command
     that takes 'pkg' as argument.
   * ESS[R]: New command 'C-c C-e C-r' to reload the inferior process.
     Currently only implemented for R. The R method runs
     'inferior-ess-r-reload-hook' on reloading.
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-r-package-mode' is now activated in non-file buffers
     as well.

   Bug fixes in 16.10:
   * ESS[R]: Fix broken (un)flagging for debugging inside packages
   * ESS[R]: Fixes (and improvements) in Package development
   * ESS[R]: Completion no longer produces '...=' inside 'list( )'.
   * ESS[R]: Better debugging and tracing in packages.
   * ESS[R]: Better detection of symbols at point.
   * ESS[R]: No more spurious warnings on deletion of temporary files.
   * ESS[julia]: help and completion work (better)
   * ESS[julia]: available via 'ess-remote'

   Changes and New Features in 16.04:

   * ESS[R]: 'developer' functionality has been refactored.  The new
     user interface consists of a single command
     'ess-r-set-evaluation-env' bound by default to 'C-c C-t C-s'.  Once
     an evaluation environment has been set with, all subsequent ESS
     evaluation will source the code into that environment.  By default,
     for file within R packages the evaluation environment is set to the
     package environment.  Set 'ess-r-package-auto-set-evaluation-env'
     to 'nil' to disable this.
   * ESS[R]: New 'ess-r-package-mode' This development mode provides
     features to make package development easier.  Currently, most of
     the commands are based on the 'devtools' packages and are
     accessible with 'C-c C-w' prefix.  See the documentation of
     'ess-r-package-mode' function for all available commands.  With
     'C-u' prefix each command asks for extra arguments to the
     underlying devtools function.  This mode is automatically enabled
     in all files within R packages and is indicated with '[pkg:NAME]'
     in the mode-line.
   * ESS[R]: Help lookup has been improved.  It is now possible to get
     help for namespaced objects such as pkg::foobar.  Furthermore, ESS
     recognizes more reliably when you change 'options('html_type')'.
   * ESS[R]: New specialized breakpoints for debugging magrittr pipes
   * ESS: ESS now implements a simple message passing interface to
     communicate between ESS and inferior process.

   Bug fixes in 16.04:
   * ESS[R]: Roxygen blocks with backtics are now correctly filled
   * ESS[R]: Don't skip breakpoints in magrittr's 'debug_pipe'
   * ESS[R]: Error highlighting now understands 'testthat' type errors
   * ESS[Julia]: Added getwd and setwd generic commands
