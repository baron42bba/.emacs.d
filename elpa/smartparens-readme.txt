Smartparens is minor mode for Emacs that deals with parens pairs
and tries to be smart about it.  It started as a unification effort
to combine functionality of several existing packages in a single,
compatible and extensible way to deal with parentheses, delimiters,
tags and the like.  Some of these packages include autopair,
textmate, wrap-region, electric-pair-mode, paredit and others.  With
the basic features found in other packages it also brings many
improvements as well as completely new features.
