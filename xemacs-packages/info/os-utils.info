1 The Operating System Utilities Package
****************************************

This Info file contains the manual for the Operating System Utilities
package.

The node name for each entry in the menu is the name of the elisp file
containing the code that implements the functionality described.  It is
highly recommended that you briefly peruse the elisp source code since
it can provide valuable information on usage and technique.  This can
easily be done by typing `C-x 4 l <filename> RET' where <filename> is
the name of the elisp file to be loaded.

2 Copying
*********

This document may be redistributed, verbatim or in modified form, under
the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or any later
version.  The same terms apply to the libraries it documents.  A copy
of the General Public License is provided as an Appendix.

   Most XEmacs documentation has its own license, which is an ancestor
of the GNU Free Documentation License ("FDL"), and whose terms are
quite similar to those imposed by GNU on Emacs documentation.  Why is
this manual licensed differently (under the GNU General Public License,
or "GPL"), and why does it have to be distributed separately from the
XEmacs User's Guide and the XEmacs Lisp Reference Manual?

   Taking the second question first, XEmacs is "community-owned"
software.  That is, unlike GNU Emacs, there is no monopoly copyright
holder.  Many of us, including the original Lucid authors, have
contributed our copyrights to the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and of
course much content is derived from GNU Emacs, and therefore is held by
the FSF.  Another large chunk is held by Sun Microsystems, and a few
individual authors hold copyright to thousands of lines each.  But many
individuals hold copyright to only a few dozen lines.  Like the Linux
kernel, copyright ownership is distributed throughout a community.

   However, its license is "copyleft," _i.e._, it _requires_ that you
redistribute it under terms _identical_ to those under which you
received it, unless you have explicit permission of the copyright
holder.  Because of the multiple owners, determining the ownership of
any given part of XEmacs is tedious, and perhaps impossible.  For
practical purposes, then, the license of any substantial chunk of
existing XEmacs content cannot be changed, except to a later version of
the GPL, for those parts under GPL.  (That is due to the _explicit_
permission to change to a later version of the GPL, present in every
file of XEmacs.)

   Unfortunately, this severe restriction means that the GPL, FDL, and
the XEmacs documentation license ("XDL") are _mutually incompatible_.
That is, content licensed under any of the GPL, FDL, or XDL _may not_
be mixed with content licensed under either of the other two without
changing the license of some of the content.  But this requires
permission of the copyright holder, which is often difficult or
impossible to get.

   For example, you _may not_ take comments or docstrings from XEmacs
code and add them to the Lispref to mend a gap in the latter's coverage.
You _may not_ copy text from the Lispref into docstrings in the code.
And you _may not_ copy text from the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference to the
XEmacs Lisp Reference Manual.  (In this case it is at least trivial to
ask permission, although it is rather unclear whether it would be
granted.)

   In fact, parts of this document were derived by copying from XEmacs
code under the GPL, without any further permission from the authors.
Thus, this document must be distributed under the GPL, as a "volume"
separate from the XEmacs documentation under the XDL.  Note that the
"mere aggregation" clauses allow us to distribute in the same tarball.
But incorporating it as a node in the Lispref is prohibited, even if
done by inclusion.

   A bit of advocacy:

   If you look carefully at the additional restrictions imposed by the
soi-disant "free" documentation licenses, you discover that they are
simply proprietary restrictions guaranteeing a certain amount of
_unpaid_ political advertising to the Free Software Foundation and GNU
Project (and in the case of the FDL, this is extended to commercial
advertising by authors of original or derived works).  Whether this is
"ethically justified" or not is a difficult question.  What is certain
is that there is little social benefit to these terms (since the license
documents themselves contain the advocacy and must be included with any
distribution).

   I conclude it makes sense for XEmacs to reduce its restrictions,
where possible, to the "least common denominator," the GNU General
Public License.

3 Simple Editing of TAR Files
*****************************

This package attempts to make dealing with Unix 'tar' archives easier.
When this code is loaded, visiting a file whose name ends in '.tar'
will cause the contents of that archive file to be displayed in a
Dired-like listing.  It is then possible to use the customary Dired
keybindings to extract sub-files from that archive, either by reading
them into their own editor buffers, or by copying them directly to
arbitrary files on disk.  It is also possible to delete sub-files from
within the tar file and write the modified archive back to disk, or to
edit sub-files within the archive and re-insert the modified files into
the archive.  See the documentation string of `tar-mode' for more info.

   To configure this package, type:

       M-x customize-group RET tar RET

5 Handling for Compressed and Encrypted Files
*********************************************

The basic purpose of this package of Lisp functions is to recognize
automatically encrypted and encoded (i.e., compressed) files when they
are first visited or written.  The BUFFER corresponding to the file is
decoded and/or decrypted before it is presented to the user.  The file
itself is unchanged on the disk.  When the buffer is subsequently saved
to disk, a hook function re-encodes the buffer before the actual disk
write takes place.

   This package recognizes all sorts of compressed files by a magic
number at the beginning of these files but uses a heuristic to detect
encrypted files.  If you are asked for an encryption key for a file
that is in fact not encrypted, just hit RET and the file will be
accepted as is, and the crypt minor mode will not be entered.

   Other types of encoding programs may be added to this package by
using the variable `crypt-encoding-alist' which contains a table of
encoding programs such as `compress', `gzip' (GNU zip), `freeze', and
`compact'.

   This new extended version of crypt now monitors the filename
extensions of buffers that are written out using `write-file' (`C-x
C-w').  If the filename extension matches one of the extensions listed
in `crypt-encoding-alist', then this package will write the file out
using the corresponding encoding (compression) method. This is done
whether or not the buffer originated from a previously encoded
(compressed) file.

   Thus, if the user is editing a file that may or may not have been
encoded originally (e.g., `foobar.Z' or `foobar') and decides to write
it to a different file (e.g., `barfoo' or `barfoo.z' or `barfoo.C').
This package will examine the filename extension and write the buffer
in plain format or an alternate encoding (compression) format by
searching through the entries in the table of encoding methods
`crypt-encoding-alist'.  This change in encoding state is done
automatically if the variable `crypt-auto-write-buffer' is t otherwise
the user is asked.

   To use this package, put the line `(require 'crypt)' in your
initialization file.  Do not bother trying to autoload this file; this
package uses `find-file' and `write-file' hooks and thus should be
loaded the first time you visit any sort of file.  Any package loaded
after this one that appends something to `write-file-hooks' will not be
executed because this package writes out the file.  Other packages that
append to `write-file-hooks' should either be modified to prepend to
that hook or be loaded before this one (preferably the former).

   NOTE: encryption users should set `crypt-encryption-type' to one of
the values in `crypt-encryption-alist'.

   To configure this package, type:

       M-x customize-group RET compression RET

6 Reading/Writing/Loading Compressed Files
******************************************

This package implements low-level support for reading, writing, and
loading compressed files.  It hooks into the low-level file I/O
functions (including `write-region' and `insert-file-contents') so that
they automatically compress or uncompress a file if the file appears to
need it (based on the extension of the file name).  Packages like
Rmail, VM, GNUS, and Info should be able to work with compressed files
without modification.

   The operation of this package should be transparent to the user
(except for messages appearing when a file is being compressed or
uncompressed).

   The variable, `jka-compr-compression-info-list' can be used to
customize `jka-compr' to work with other compression programs.  The
default value of this variable allows `jka-compr' to work with Unix
compress and gzip.

   To activate this package, add the following to your initialization
file:

       (toggle-auto-compression 1 t)  ; enable compression/decompression

   To configure this package, type:

       M-x customize-group RET jka-compr RET


File: os-utils.info,  Node: uncompress,  Next: telnet,  Prev: jka-compr,  Up: Top

7 Auto-Decompression Hook for Visiting .Z Files
***********************************************

This package can be used to arrange for automatic uncompress of
compressed files when they are visited.  All that's necessary is to
load it.  This can conveniently be done from your initialization file.

   `M-x auto-compression-mode' is a more modern replacement for this
package.

8 Execute a Telnet Session From Within an Emacs Buffer
******************************************************

This mode is intended to be used for telnet or rsh to a remote host;
`telnet' and `rsh' are the two entry points.  Multiple telnet or rsh
sessions are supported.

   Normally, input is sent to the remote telnet/rsh line-by-line, as
you type `RET' or `LFD'.  `C-c C-c' sends a `C-c' to the remote
immediately; `C-c C-z' sends `C-z' immediately.  `C-c C-q' followed by
any character sends that character immediately.

   All `RET' characters are filtered out of the output coming back from
the remote system.  The mode tries to do other useful translations
based on what it sees coming back from the other system before the
password query.  It knows about UNIX, ITS, TOPS-20 and Explorer systems.

   You can use the global `telnet-host-properties' to associate a telnet
program and login name with each host you regularly telnet to.

   To configure this package, type:

       M-x customize-group RET telnet RET

9 Remote Login Interface Using SSH
**********************************

This package provides support for remote logins using `ssh'.  The
package is layered on top of shell.el; the code here only accounts for
the variations needed to handle a remote process, e.g. directory
tracking and the sending of some special characters.

   If you wish for ssh mode to prompt you in the minibuffer for
passwords when a password prompt appears, just enter `M-x
send-invisible' and type in your line, or add
`comint-watch-for-password-prompt' to `comint-output-filter-functions'.

   To configure this package, type:

       M-x customize-group RET ssh RET


File: os-utils.info,  Node: ftelnet,  Next: rlogin,  Prev: ssh,  Up: Top

10 Remote Login Interface Using Telnet
**************************************

This package provides support for remote logins using `telnet'.  The
package is layered on top of shell.el; the code here only accounts for
the variations needed to handle a remote process, e.g. directory
tracking and the sending of some special characters.

   If you wish for ftelnet mode to prompt you in the minibuffer for
passwords when a password prompt appears, just enter `M-x
send-invisible' and type in your line, or add
`comint-watch-for-password-prompt' to `comint-output-filter-functions'.

package is layered on top of shell.el; the code here only accounts for
the variations needed to handle a remote process, e.g. directory
tracking and the sending of some special characters.

File: os-utils.info,  Node: mchat,  Next: kermit,  Prev: rlogin,  Up: Top

12 Multicast Chatting
*********************

MChat is a package allowing a conversation to take place between a
potentially infinite number of people across the Internet. It uses the
Multicast support that has been added to XEmacs in the early 21.0 days.
At that time a rudimentary version of MChat was written, merely to
illustrate the feature, and almost nobody knew it, apart from the other
developers. This version is much improved and completely backwards
incompatible ;-).

   NOTE: before using this package, you most likely have to customize
the `mchat-nsl-method' first. It specifies a program like `nsl' or
`nslookup' in order to retrieve the IP number of your machine.

   The main entry point to the package is the `mchat' function which
allows you to open a multicast group based on the MChat protocol. There
are a number a variables that can be customized and their doc-string
should be self-explanatory. You might also want to look at the bindings
(`C-h b') in MChat buffers, or at the menubar entries to get an idea of
what you can do.

   WARNING: the current version (but there's also a limitation in the
internals of XEmacs's processes) doesn't let you send messages longer
than 500 octets or so, including the protocol header. I plan to change
this in the future (see the todo list).

   To configure this package, type:

       M-x customize-group RET mchat RET

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
