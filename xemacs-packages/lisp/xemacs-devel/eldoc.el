;;; Commentary:

;; This program was inspired by the behavior of the "mouse documentation
;; window" on many Lisp Machine systems; as you type a function's symbol
;; name as part of a sexp, it will print the argument list for that
;; function.  Behavior is not identical; for example, you need not actually
;; type the function name, you need only move point around in a sexp that
;; calls it.  Also, if point is over a documented variable, it will print
;; the one-line documentation for that variable instead, to remind you of
;; that variable's meaning.

;; One useful way to enable this minor mode is to put the following in your
;; .emacs:
;;
;;      (autoload 'turn-on-eldoc-mode "eldoc" nil t)
;;      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)
;;      (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)
;;      (add-hook 'ielm-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)

;;; Code:

;; Use idle timers if available in the version of emacs running.
;; Please don't change this to use `require'; this package works as-is in
;; XEmacs (which doesn't have timer.el as of 19.14), and I would like to
;; maintain compatibility with that since I must use it sometimes.  --Noah
