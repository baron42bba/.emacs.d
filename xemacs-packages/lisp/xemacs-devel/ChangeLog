	Redo interface to eliminate major principle-of-least-surprise
	violations and make it overall much more convenient.  Goes hand-in-
	hand with changes on the C level, but still supports the old
	C level interface.

	Add new low-level functions save-profiling-info,
	combine-profiling-info and (C level) set-profiling-info, which
	together allow you full control over the profiling process and
	allow you to properly implement things like nested profile runs,
	combining many different profile results into a whole, etc.

	Remove obsolete (4 years old) pretty-print-profiling-info.
	Remove profile-call-count-results.  Call counts and now an
	integral part of the profiling info, and the only real benefit
	of this function (sort by call-count) is an argument or C-u to
	profile-results.

	* ielm.el (ielm-eval-input): Change `:', `::', `:::' to `!'...,
	since the `:' is special syntax now for keyword variables.
