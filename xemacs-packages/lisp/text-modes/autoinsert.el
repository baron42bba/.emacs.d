;;; Commentary:

;;  The following defines an association list for text to be
;;  automatically inserted when a new file is created, and a function
;;  which automatically inserts these files; the idea is to insert
;;  default text much as the mode is automatically set using
;;  auto-mode-alist.
;;
;;  To use: 
;;     (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'auto-insert)
;;     setq auto-insert-directory to an appropriate slash-terminated value
