;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides remote file editing, similar to ange-ftp.
;; The difference is that ange-ftp uses FTP to transfer files between
;; the local and the remote host, whereas tramp.el uses a combination
;; of rsh and rcp or other work-alike programs, such as ssh/scp.
;;
;; For more detailed instructions, please see the info file.
;;
;; Notes:
;; -----
;;
;; This package only works for Emacs 20 and higher, and for XEmacs 21
;; and higher.  (XEmacs 20 is missing the `with-timeout' macro.  Emacs
;; 19 is reported to have other problems.  For XEmacs 21, you need the
;; package `fsf-compat' for the `with-timeout' macro.)
;;
;; This version might not work with pre-Emacs 21 VC unless VC is
;; loaded before tramp.el.  Could you please test this and tell me about
;; the result?  Thanks.
;;
;; Also see the todo list at the bottom of this file.
;;
;; The current version of Tramp can be retrieved from the following URL:
;;            http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/
;;
;; There's a mailing list for this, as well.  Its name is:
;;            tramp-devel@gnu.org
;; You can use the Web to subscribe, under the following URL:

  "*Alist of methods for remote files.
This is a list of entries of the form (NAME PARAM1 PARAM2 ...).
Each NAME stands for a remote access method.  Each PARAM is a
pair of the form (KEY VALUE).  The following KEYs are defined:
 * `tramp-connection-function'
    This specifies the function to use to connect to the remote host.
    Currently, `tramp-open-connection-rsh', `tramp-open-connection-telnet'
    and `tramp-open-connection-su' are defined.  See the documentation
    of these functions for more details.
  * `tramp-remote-sh'
    This specifies the Bourne shell to use on the remote host.  This
    MUST be a Bourne-like shell.  It is normally not necessary to set
    this to any value other than \"/bin/sh\": tramp wants to use a shell
    which groks tilde expansion, but it can search for it.  Also note
    that \"/bin/sh\" exists on all Unixen, this might not be true for
    the value that you decide to use.  You Have Been Warned.
  * `tramp-login-program'
    This specifies the name of the program to use for logging in to the
    remote host.  Depending on `tramp-connection-function', this may be
    the name of rsh or a workalike program (when
    `tramp-connection-function' is `tramp-open-connection-rsh'), or the
    name of telnet or a workalike (for `tramp-open-connection-telnet'),
    or the name of su or a workalike (for `tramp-open-connection-su').
  * `tramp-login-args'
    This specifies the list of arguments to pass to the above
    mentioned program.  Please note that this is a list of arguments,
    that is, normally you don't want to put \"-a -b\" or \"-f foo\"
    here.  Instead, you want two list elements, one for \"-a\" and one
    for \"-b\", or one for \"-f\" and one for \"foo\".
    If `tramp-connection-function' is `tramp-open-connection-su', then
    \"%u\" in this list is replaced by the user name, and \"%%\" can
    be used to obtain a literal percent character.
  * `tramp-copy-program'
    This specifies the name of the program to use for remotely copying
    the file; this might be the absolute filename of rcp or the name of
    a workalike program.
  * `tramp-copy-args'
    This specifies the list of parameters to pass to the above mentioned
    program, the hints for `tramp-login-args' also apply here.
  * `tramp-copy-keep-date-arg'
    This specifies the parameter to use for the copying program when the
    timestamp of the original file should be kept.  For `rcp', use `-p', for
    `rsync', use `-t'.
  * `tramp-password-end-of-line'
    This specifies the string to use for terminating the line after
    submitting the password.  If this method parameter is nil, then the
    value of the normal variable `tramp-default-password-end-of-line'
    is used.  This parameter is necessary because the \"plink\" program
    requires any two characters after sending the password.  These do
    not have to be newline or carriage return characters.  Other login
    programs are happy with just one character, the newline character.
    We use \"xy\" as the value for methods using \"plink\".

What does all this mean?  Well, you should specify `tramp-login-program'
for all methods; this program is used to log in to the remote site.  Then,
there are two ways to actually transfer the files between the local and the
remote side.  One way is using an additional rcp-like program.  If you want
to do this, set `tramp-copy-program' in the method.

Another possibility for file transfer is inline transfer, i.e. the
file is passed through the same buffer used by `tramp-login-program'.  In
this case, the file contents need to be protected since the
`tramp-login-program' might use escape codes or the connection might not
be eight-bit clean.  Therefore, file contents are encoded for transit.
See the variable `tramp-coding-commands' for details.

So, to summarize: if the method is an out-of-band method, then you
must specify `tramp-copy-program' and `tramp-copy-args'.  If it is an
inline method, then these two parameters should be nil.  Every method,
inline or out of band, must specify `tramp-connection-function' plus
the associated arguments (for example, the login program if you chose
`tramp-open-connection-telnet').

Notes:

When using `tramp-open-connection-su' the phrase `open connection to a
remote host' sounds strange, but it is used nevertheless, for
consistency.  No connection is opened to a remote host, but `su' is
started on the local host.  You are not allowed to specify a remote
host other than `localhost' or the name of the local host."

In the Emacs normally running Tramp, evaluate the above code
\(replace \"xxx\" and \"yyy\" by the remote user and host name,
respectively).  You can do this, for example, by pasting it into
the `*scratch*' buffer and then hitting C-j with the cursor after the
last closing parenthesis.  Note that it works only if you have configured
\"ssh\" to run without password query, see ssh-agent(1).

You will see the number of bytes sent successfully to the remote host.
If that number exceeds 1000, you can stop the execution by hitting
C-g, because your Emacs is likely clean.

If your Emacs is buggy, the code stops and gives you an indication
about the value `tramp-chunksize' should be set.  Maybe you could just
experiment a bit, e.g. changing the values of `init' and `step'
in the third line of the code.

When it is necessary to set `tramp-chunksize', you might consider to
use an out-of-the-band method (like \"scp\") instead of an internal one
\(like \"ssh\"), because setting `tramp-chunksize' to non-nil decreases
performance.

this variable to be set as well."

;; In Emacs, there is some concurrency due to timers.  If a timer
;; interrupts Tramp and wishes to use the same connection buffer as
;; the "main" Emacs, then garbage might occur in the connection
;; buffer.  Therefore, we need to make sure that a timer does not use
;; the same connection buffer as the "main" Emacs.  We implement a
;; cheap global lock, instead of locking each connection buffer
;; separately.  The global lock is based on two variables,
;; `tramp-locked' and `tramp-locker'.  `tramp-locked' is set to true
;; (with setq) to indicate a lock.  But Tramp also calls itself during
;; processing of a single file operation, so we need to allow
;; recursive calls.  That's where the `tramp-locker' variable comes in
;; -- it is let-bound to t during the execution of the current
;; handler.  So if `tramp-locked' is t and `tramp-locker' is also t,
;; then we should just proceed because we have been called
;; recursively.  But if `tramp-locker' is nil, then we are a timer
;; interrupting the "main" Emacs, and then we signal an error.

;; Currently (as of Emacs 20.5), the function `shell-quote-argument'
;; does not deal well with newline characters.  Newline is replaced by
;; backslash newline.  But if, say, the string `a backslash newline b'
;; is passed to a shell, the shell will expand this into "ab",
;; completely omitting the newline.  This is not what was intended.
;; It does not appear to be possible to make the function
;; `shell-quote-argument' work with newlines without making it
;; dependent on the shell used.  But within this package, we know that
;; we will always use a Bourne-like shell, so we use an approach which
;; groks newlines.
;;
;; The approach is simple: we call `shell-quote-argument', then
;; massage the newline part of the result.
;;
;; This function should produce a string which is grokked by a Unix
;; shell, even if the Emacs is running on Windows.  Since this is the
;; kludges section, we bind `system-type' in such a way that
;; `shell-quote-arguments'  behaves as if on Unix.
;;
;; Thanks to Mario DeWeerd for the hint that it is sufficient for this
;; function to work with Bourne-like shells.

;;; TODO:

;; * Allow putting passwords in the filename.
;;   This should be implemented via a general mechanism to add
;;   parameters in filenames.  There is currently a kludge for
;;   putting the port number into the filename for ssh and ftp
;;   files.  This could be subsumed by the new mechanism as well.
;;   Another approach is to read a netrc file like ~/.authinfo
;;   from Gnus.
;; * Handle nonlocal exits such as C-g.
;; * Autodetect if remote `ls' groks the "--dired" switch.
;; * Add fallback for inline encodings.  This should be used
;;   if the remote end doesn't support mimencode or a similar program.
;;   For reading files from the remote host, we can just parse the output
;;   of `od -b'.  For writing files to the remote host, we construct
;;   a shell program which contains only "safe" ascii characters
;;   and which writes the right bytes to the file.  We can use printf(1)
;;   or "echo -e" or the printf function in awk and use octal escapes
;;   for the "dangerous" characters.  The null byte might be a problem.
;;   On some systems, the octal escape doesn't work.  So we try the following
;;   two commands to write a null byte:
;;   dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=1
;;   echo | tr '\n' '\000'
;; * Separate local `tramp-coding-commands' from remote ones.  Connect
;;   the two via a format which can be `uu' or `b64'.  Then we can search
;;   for the right local commands and the right remote commands separately.
;; * Cooperate with PCL-CVS.  It uses start-process, which doesn't
;;   work for remote files.
;; * Rewrite `tramp-shell-quote-argument' to abstain from using
;;   `shell-quote-argument'.
;; * Completion gets confused when you leave out the method name.
;; * In Emacs 21, `insert-directory' shows total number of bytes used
;;   by the files in that directory.  Add this here.
;; * Avoid screen blanking when hitting `g' in dired.  (Eli Tziperman)
;; * Make ffap.el grok Tramp filenames.  (Eli Tziperman)
;; * When logging in, keep looking for questions according to an alist
;;   and then invoke the right function.
;; * Case-insensitive filename completion.  (Norbert Goevert.)
;; * Running CVS remotely doesn't appear to work right.  It thinks
;;   files are locked by somebody else even if I'm the locking user.
;;   Sometimes, one gets `No CVSROOT specified' errors from CVS.
;;   (Skip Montanaro)
;; * Don't use globbing for directories with many files, as this is
;;   likely to produce long command lines, and some shells choke on
;;   long command lines.
;; * Find out about the new auto-save mechanism in Emacs 21 and
;;   do the right thing.
;; * `vc-directory' does not work.  It never displays any files, even
;;   if it does show files when run locally.
;; * Allow correction of passwords, if the remote end allows this.
;;   (Mark Hershberger)
;; * How to deal with MULE in `insert-file-contents' and `write-region'?
;; * Do asynchronous `shell-command's.
;; * Grok `append' parameter for `write-region'.
;; * Test remote ksh or bash for tilde expansion in `tramp-find-shell'?
;; * abbreviate-file-name
;; * grok ~ in tramp-remote-path  (Henrik Holm <henrikh@tele.ntnu.no>)
;; * Also allow to omit user names when doing multi-hop.  Not sure yet
;;   what the user names should default to, though.
;; * better error checking.  At least whenever we see something
;;   strange when doing zerop, we should kill the process and start
;;   again.  (Greg Stark)
;; * Add caching for filename completion.  (Greg Stark)
;;   Of course, this has issues with usability (stale cache bites)
;;      -- <daniel@danann.net>
;; * Provide a local cache of old versions of remote files for the rsync
;;   transfer method to use.  (Greg Stark)
;; * Remove unneeded parameters from methods.
;; * Invoke rsync once for copying a whole directory hierarchy.
;;   (Francesco Potort,Al(B)
;; * Should we set PATH ourselves or should we rely on the remote end
;;   to do it?
;; * Make it work for XEmacs 20, which is missing `with-timeout'.
;; * Make it work for different encodings, and for different file name
;;   encodings, too.  (Daniel Pittman)
;; * Change applicable functions to pass a struct tramp-file-name rather
;;   than the individual items MULTI-METHOD, METHOD, USER, HOST, LOCALNAME.
;; * Implement asynchronous shell commands.
;; * Clean up unused *tramp/foo* buffers after a while.  (Pete Forman)
;; * Progress reports while copying files.  (Michael Kifer)
;; * `Smart' connection method that uses inline for small and out of
;;   band for large files.  (Michael Kifer)
;; * Don't search for perl5 and perl.  Instead, only search for perl and
;;   then look if it's the right version (with `perl -v').
;; * When editing a remote CVS controlled file as a different user, VC
;;   gets confused about the file locking status.  Try to find out why
;;   the workaround doesn't work.
;; * Change `copy-file' to grok the case where the filename handler
;;   for the source and the target file are different.  Right now,
;;   it looks at the source file and then calls that handler, if
;;   there is one.  But since ange-ftp, for instance, does not know
;;   about Tramp, it does not do the right thing if the target file
;;   name is a Tramp name.
;; * Username and hostname completion.
;; ** If `partial-completion-mode' isn't loaded, "/foo:bla" tries to
;;    connect to host "blabla" already if that host is unique. No idea
;;    how to suppress. Maybe not an essential problem.
;; ** Try to avoid usage of `last-input-event' in `tramp-completion-mode'.
;; ** Extend `tramp-get-completion-su' for NIS and shadow passwords.
;; ** Unify `tramp-parse-{rhosts,shosts,sconfig,hosts,passwd,netrc}'.
;;    Code is nearly identical.
;; ** Decide whiche files to take for searching user/host names depending on
;;    operating system (windows-nt) in `tramp-completion-function-alist'.
;; ** Enhance variables for debug.
;; ** Implement "/multi:" completion.
;; ** Add a learning mode for completion. Make results persistent.
;; * Allow out-of-band methods as _last_ multi-hop.
