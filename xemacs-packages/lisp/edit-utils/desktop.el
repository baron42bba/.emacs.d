;;; Synched up with: GNU Emacs 20.1, partially with 21.2.

;;; Commentary:

;; Save the Desktop, i.e.,
;;	- some global variables
;; 	- the list of buffers with associated files.  For each buffer also
;;		- the major mode
;;		- the default directory
;;		- the point
;;		- the mark & mark-active
;;		- buffer-read-only
;;		- some local variables

;; To use this, first put these two lines in the bottom of your .emacs
;; file (the later the better):
;;
;;	(desktop-load-default)
;;	(desktop-read)
;;
;; Between these two lines you may wish to add something that updates the
;; variables `desktop-globals-to-save' and/or `desktop-locals-to-save'.  If
;; for instance you want to save the local variable `foobar' for every buffer
;; in which it is local, you could add the line
;;
;;	(setq desktop-locals-to-save (cons 'foobar desktop-locals-to-save))
;;
;; To avoid saving excessive amounts of data you may also wish to add
;; something like the following
;;
;;	(add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook
;;		  '(lambda ()
;;		     (desktop-truncate search-ring 3)
;;		     (desktop-truncate regexp-search-ring 3)))
;;
;; which will make sure that no more than three search items are saved.  You
;; must place this line *after* the `(desktop-load-default)' line.  See also
;; the variable `desktop-save-hook'.

;; Start Emacs in the root directory of your "project". The desktop saver
;; is inactive by default.  You activate it by M-x desktop-save RET.  When
;; you exit the next time the above data will be saved.  This ensures that
;; all the files you were editing will be reloaded the next time you start
;; Emacs from the same directory and that points will be set where you
;; left them.  If you save a desktop file in your home directory it will
;; act as a default desktop when you start Emacs from a directory that
;; doesn't have its own.  I never do this, but you may want to.

;; Some words on minor modes: Most minor modes are controlled by
;; buffer-local variables, which have a standard save / restore
;; mechanism.  To handle all minor modes, we take the following
;; approach: (1) check whether the variable name from
;; `minor-mode-alist' is also a function; and (2) use translation
;; table `desktop-minor-mode-table' in the case where the two names
;; are not the same.

;; By the way: don't use desktop.el to customize Emacs -- the file .emacs
;; in your home directory is used for that.  Saving global default values
;; for buffers is an example of misuse.

;; PLEASE NOTE: The kill ring can be saved as specified by the variable
;; `desktop-globals-to-save' (by default it isn't).  This may result in saving
;; things you did not mean to keep.  Use M-x desktop-clear RET.
