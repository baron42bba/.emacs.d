;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs's standard method for making buffer names unique adds <2>, <3>,
;; etc. to the end of (all but one of) the buffers.  This file replaces
;; that behavior, for buffers visiting files and dired buffers, with a
;; uniquification that adds parts of the file name until the buffer names
;; are unique.  For instance, buffers visiting /u/mernst/tmp/Makefile and
;; /usr/projects/zaphod/Makefile would be named Makefile|tmp and
;; Makefile|zaphod, respectively (instead of Makefile and Makefile<2>).
;; Other buffer name styles are also available.

;; To use this file, load it or add (require 'uniquify) to your ".emacs"
;; and set `uniquify-buffer-name-style' to one of its non-nil alternative
;; values.

;; For other options, see "User-visible variables", below.

;; A version of uniquify.el that works under Emacs 18, Emacs 19, XEmacs 19,
;; and InfoDock is available from the maintainer.

;;; Hooks from the rest of Emacs

;; The logical place to put all this code is in generate-new-buffer-name.
;; It's written in C, so we would add a generate-new-buffer-name-function
;; which, if non-nil, would be called instead of the C.  One problem with
;; that is that generate-new-buffer-name takes a potential buffer name as
;; its argument -- not other information, such as what file the buffer will
;; visit.

;; The below solution works because generate-new-buffer-name is called
;; only by rename-buffer (which, as of 19.29, is never called from C) and
;; generate-new-buffer, which is called only by Lisp functions
;; create-file-buffer and rename-uniquely.  Rename-uniquely generally
;; isn't used for buffers visiting files, so it's sufficient to hook
;; rename-buffer and create-file-buffer.  (Setting find-file-hooks isn't
