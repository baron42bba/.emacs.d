;;; Commentary:

;; Many editors (e.g. Vim) have the feature of saving minibuffer
;; history to an external file after exit.  This package provides the
;; same feature in Emacs.  When set up, it saves recorded minibuffer
;; histories to a file (`~/.emacs-history' by default).  Additional
;; variables may be specified by customizing
;; `savehist-additional-variables'.

;; To use savehist, turn on savehist-mode by putting the following in
;; `~/.emacs':
;;
;;     (savehist-mode 1)
;;
;; or with customize: `M-x customize-option RET savehist-mode RET'.
;;
;; You can also explicitly save history with `M-x savehist-save' and
;; load it by loading the `savehist-file' with `M-x load-file'.

;; If you are using a version of Emacs that does not ship with this
;; package, be sure to have `savehist.el' in a directory that is in
;; your load-path, and to byte-compile it.
