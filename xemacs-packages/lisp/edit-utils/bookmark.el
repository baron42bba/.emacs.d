;;; Commentary:

;; This package is for setting "bookmarks" in files.  A bookmark
;; associates a string with a location in a certain file.  Thus, you
;; can navigate your way to that location by providing the string.
;; See the "User Variables" section for customizations.

;; Thanks to David Bremner <bremner@cs.sfu.ca> for thinking of and
;; then implementing the bookmark-current-bookmark idea.  He even
;; sent *patches*, bless his soul...

;; Thanks to Gregory M. Saunders <saunders@cis.ohio-state.edu> for
;; fixing and improving bookmark-time-to-save-p.

;; Thanks go to Andrew V. Klein <avk@cig.mot.com> for the code that
;; sorts the alist before presenting it to the user (in bookmark-bmenu-list
;; and the menu-bar).

;; And much thanks to David Hughes <djh@harston.cv.com> for many small
;; suggestions and the code to implement them (like
;; bookmark-bmenu-check-position, and some of the Lucid compatibility
;; stuff).

;; Kudos (whatever they are) go to Jim Blandy <jimb@red-bean.com>
;; for his eminently sensible suggestion to separate bookmark-jump
;; into bookmark-jump and bookmark-jump-noselect, which made many
;; other things cleaner as well.

;; Thanks to Roland McGrath for encouragement and help with defining
;; autoloads on the menu-bar.

;; Jonathan Stigelman <stig@hackvan.com> gave patches for default
;; values in bookmark-jump and bookmark-set.  Everybody please keep
;; all the keystrokes they save thereby and send them to him at the
;; end of each year :-)  (No, seriously, thanks Jonathan!)

;; Buckets of gratitude to John Grabowski <johng@media.mit.edu> for
;; thinking up the annotations feature and implementing it so well.

;; Based on info-bookmark.el, by Karl Fogel and Ken Olstad
;; <olstad@msc.edu>.

;; Thanks to Mikio Nakajima <PBC01764@niftyserve.or.jp> for many bugs
;; reported and fixed.

;; Thank you, Michael Kifer, for contributing the XEmacs support.

;; Enough with the credits already, get on to the good stuff:

;; FAVORITE CHINESE RESTAURANT: 
;; Boy, that's a tough one.  Probably Hong Min, or maybe Emperor's
;; Choice (both in Chicago's Chinatown).  Well, both.  How about you?

;;; Misc comments:
;;
;; If variable bookmark-use-annotations is non-nil, an annotation is
;; queried for when setting a bookmark.  
;;
;; The bookmark list is sorted lexically by default, but you can turn
;; this off by setting bookmark-sort-flag to nil.  If it is nil, then
;; the list will be presented in the order it is recorded
