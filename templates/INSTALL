The installation process with explanations (all files mentioned here are
relative to top-level directory "template/" in the distribution):


 1. Copy file "lisp/template.el" to your load-path.  That means:

    Use C-h v load-path RET to check the value and the documentation of
    Emacs' load-path.

    You must copy "lisp/template.el" to one of the directories in the
    value list.  If no directory in the default value is appropriate, you
    must add "your own" directory to that list.

    The cases:

      (a) You want to copy the file to DIR, i.e., one of the listed
          directories: copy "lisp/template.el" to DIR.

      (b) You use Emacs and install Template in your home directory:
          create directory "~/.emacs.d/lisp/" and copy "lisp/template.el"
          to it.  Add the following lines at the beginning of your Emacs
          init file:

             (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
                             load-path))

      (c) You use XEmacs-20.3 or higher and install Template in your
          home directory: create directory
          "~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/".  It will be automatically
          added to `load-path' if you start XEmacs the next time.

      (d) You install Template system-wide: the target directory is
          "EMACS/site-lisp/" or "XEMACS/site-packages/lisp/".  But you
          probably know that if you are responsible for Emacs or XEmacs
	  on your site.


 2. Byte-compile file "template.el": visit file "template.el" (that is,
    the copy) and use menu entry

       "Emacs-Lisp"/"Lisp" >> "Byte-compile This File"
    or
        M-x byte-compile-file RET template.el RET.

    Note: during compilation, you get warnings about missing functions.
    You can ignore them, since these functions will not be used in the
    Emacs/XEmacs branch or version you are using.


 3. Visit your Emacs init file.

     - The Emacs init file is usuall file "~/.emacs".
     - In XEmacs-21.4 or higher, it is usually "~/.xemacs/init.el".
     - For a system-wide installation, the init file is "default.el".

    Add the following lines into your init file (it should be inserted
    after the lines from case 1b):

       (require 'template)
       (template-initialize)

 4. You might want to copy the template files "templates/*.tpl" to
    "~/.templates/" and change them according to your preferences.
